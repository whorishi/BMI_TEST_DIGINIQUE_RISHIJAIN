1st Answer:-
Internet websites typically consist of two main components: the front-end and the back-end. These components work together to deliver the website's content and functionality to users. Here's a breakdown of how the front-end and back-end divisions work:

Front-end:
User Interface Design: The front-end development process begins with designing the user interface (UI) of the website. This involves creating the visual layout, selecting color schemes, typography, and arranging elements to ensure an intuitive and engaging user experience.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: The UI design is then implemented using web technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure and content of the website, CSS defines its appearance and style, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Client-Side Rendering: When a user visits a website, their web browser requests the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the server. The browser then processes these files and renders the website's UI accordingly. This process is known as client-side rendering because the rendering occurs on the user's device.

User Interaction: Front-end development also includes handling user interactions such as button clicks, form submissions, and input validation. JavaScript is commonly used to capture these events and perform actions based on user input, such as making AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) requests to the server to fetch or submit data without refreshing the entire page.

Back-end:
Server-Side Programming: The back-end development focuses on the server-side of the website. It involves writing code that runs on the web server and handles various tasks like database operations, data processing, and business logic. Popular programming languages for back-end development include Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and Node.js.

Server-Side Rendering/APIs: While the front-end handles the visual representation of a website, the back-end generates the data to be displayed. In server-side rendering, the web server dynamically generates the complete HTML of a page and sends it to the user's browser. Alternatively, the back-end can expose APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow the front-end to fetch and send data in a structured format like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

Database Management: Websites often require data storage and retrieval. The back-end interacts with a database management system (DBMS) to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Common DBMS options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite. The back-end code communicates with the database to perform tasks like user authentication, content management, and data storage.

Security and Performance: Back-end development also involves implementing security measures to protect the website and its users from attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Additionally, optimizing the back-end code and server infrastructure ensures the website performs well under varying traffic loads.

Overall, the front-end and back-end divisions collaborate to create a cohesive web experience. The front-end focuses on the user interface, while the back-end handles data processing, storage, and server-side functionality. Together, they enable websites to provide dynamic and interactive content to users across the internet.

2nd Answer:- 
In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, and the closing tag marks the end of the element. Here are some categories of tags in HTML with examples:

Headings Tags:

<h1> to <h6>: These tags represent headings of different levels. <h1> is the highest level (main heading), while <h6> is the lowest level (subheading). Example: `<h1>This is a Heading</h1>`
Paragraph Tags:

<p>: This tag defines a paragraph of text. Example: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`
Formatting Tags:

<b>: This tag makes the text bold. Example: <b>Bold text</b>
<i>: This tag makes the text italic. Example: <i>Italic text</i>
<u>: This tag underlines the text. Example: <u>Underlined text</u>
<s>: This tag strikes through the text. Example: <s>Strikethrough text</s>
Links Tags:

<a>: This tag creates a hyperlink to another web page or a specific location within the same page. Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Link text</a>
Image Tags:

<img>: This tag embeds an image into the web page. Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
Lists Tags:

<ul>: This tag creates an unordered (bulleted) list. Example:

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<ol>: This tag creates an ordered (numbered) list. Example:

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>

Table Tags:

<table>: This tag defines a table. Example:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Form Tags:

<form>: This tag creates an HTML form for user input. Example:

<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

Division Tags:

<div>: This tag is a generic container that divides the web page into sections or groups elements together. Example: `<div>This is a division.</div>`

3rd Answer:-
The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept and technique used in web development frameworks like React. It is an abstraction of the actual browser DOM and provides a way to efficiently update and render user interfaces.

Here's an overview of the working procedure of the Virtual DOM:

Initial Rendering:

When a React application starts, it initially renders the components into a Virtual DOM representation.
The Virtual DOM is essentially a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure and properties of the actual browser DOM.
Component Updates:

When there is a change in the application state or prop values, React triggers a re-rendering of the components.
React creates a new Virtual DOM tree, representing the updated UI based on the changed state or props.
Virtual DOM Diffing:

React then performs a process called "diffing" between the previous Virtual DOM tree and the new one.
Diffing involves comparing the old and new Virtual DOM structures to identify the differences between them.
Minimal Updates:

By analyzing the differences, React determines the minimal set of changes required to update the actual browser DOM.
Instead of updating the entire DOM, React only applies the specific changes needed to reflect the new UI.

4th Answer:-
MySQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are some key differences between MySQL (a relational database management system) and NoSQL databases:

Data Model:

MySQL: MySQL is a relational database system based on a structured data model. It organizes data into tables with predefined schemas, enforcing relationships and constraints through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, column-family, or graphs. They offer more flexibility by allowing unstructured or semi-structured data without strict schemas. NoSQL databases are often referred to as "schema-less" databases.
Scalability:

MySQL: MySQL traditionally scales vertically, meaning it is optimized for running on a single server with increased resources (CPU, memory, storage). It can be challenging to scale MySQL horizontally across multiple servers.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed with horizontal scalability in mind. They can distribute data across multiple servers, enabling easy scaling by adding more machines to handle increased workload and data storage requirements.
Query Language:

MySQL: MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. SQL provides a standardized way to query, insert, update, and delete data, making it suitable for complex data retrieval and aggregation.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases may have their query languages or APIs specific to their data model. For example, MongoDB uses a query language similar to JavaScript, while Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language). These query languages are often optimized for specific use cases and data models.

5th Answer:-
  One popular DBMS (Database Management System) technology is MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving data. In MongoDB, data is stored in the form of documents, which are similar to JSON objects.

Here's an explanation of MongoDB in my own words:

MongoDB is like a digital filing cabinet where you can store your data in a flexible and dynamic manner. Instead of organizing data into rigid tables with fixed columns like in traditional relational databases, MongoDB allows you to store data as documents. These documents can have varying structures and can hold a combination of fields with different data types.

Think of each document as a self-contained entity that holds related information. Within a document, you can have nested data structures, arrays, and key-value pairs to represent complex relationships between entities. This flexibility makes MongoDB ideal for handling data that evolves over time or has unstructured or semi-structured formats.

One of the significant advantages of MongoDB is its ability to scale horizontally. You can distribute your data across multiple servers, forming a cluster, and MongoDB takes care of load balancing and data distribution. This means you can handle large amounts of data and high traffic without overwhelming a single server.

MongoDB also provides a powerful query language that allows you to retrieve and manipulate data. You can use a syntax similar to JavaScript to express your queries, making it easy to work with the data in MongoDB. Additionally, MongoDB supports indexing, which improves query performance by creating efficient data structures to speed up data retrieval.

Furthermore, MongoDB offers features like replication and sharding for data redundancy and distribution. Replication ensures that your data is safely copied to multiple servers, providing high availability and fault tolerance. Sharding allows you to partition your data across multiple servers, enabling efficient scaling and improved performance.
